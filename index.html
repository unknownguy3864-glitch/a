      <p>
        On 23rd November 2023, two strangers met on Tinder.
        No expectations. No plans. Just words.
        <br><br>
        We talked for two days — nothing dramatic,
        you used to copy my texts.

        When I asked you why,
        you smiled and said:

        “Is that a crime?”

        And honestly…
        that was one of the cutest things
        I had ever heard.
        just conversations that felt calm and familiar.
        <br><br>
        On 26th November, I confessed my feelings.
        You didn’t say yes or no.
        You asked for time — because your exams mattered.
        <br><br>
        I waited.
        <br><br>
        And on 2nd December, you chose me.
        and our love story begin.

      <h2>Chapter 2 — The Day I Fell</h2>

      <p>
        On 7th December, we fought.
        A real fight.
        Words hurt. Silence hurt more.
        But when things finally calmed down,
        I found out something that changed me forever.
        You had cried…
        because of me.
        For me.
        And in that moment,
        I made a silent promise to myself —
        I will never be the reason for her tears again.

        That day,
        I didn’t just love you.
        I chose you..

      <p>
        You weren’t just my girlfriend.
        You were the person who changed me.
        <br><br>
          You fought for us.
          You cared deeply.
          You got jealous —
          and somehow made it look adorable.
         <br><br>
          Every time you said “breakup”
          and came back saying
          “I can’t live without you,”
        <br><br>
          I fell harder.

          We were long distance.
          We never met.
          Never held hands.
        <br><br>
          But we planned everything.
        <br><br>
          “What if you come here?”
          “What will we do?”
          “How will it feel?”
        <br><br>
          Even without touching,
          we built a world.

          For one full year,
          every morning started with your picture
          and a beautiful message.

          And even though we fought —
          often at the end of every month —
          we always came back.

          Because love kept choosing us.

        We were long distance.
        <br><br>
        We never met.
        Never held hands.
        Never hugged.
        <br><br>
        Yet we saw each other on video calls,
        planned futures,
        imagined moments.
        <br><br>
        Destiny never let us meet,
        even though we desperately wanted to.
        <br><br>
        Still, for one full year,
        we loved each other deeply.

      <p>
        The second year started quietly.
        <br><br>
        In March, I went on a college trip.
        I posted a story with female classmates.
        <br><br>
        You got jealous —
        and instead of pushing me away,
        it made me love you more.
        that day mujhe laga ki tune haq jamanaya h .
        <br><br>
        But that day, something shifted.
        For the first time,
        calls were blocked.
       <br><br>
        A small distance entered our story.
       <br><br>
        In April, emotions grew heavier.
        Misunderstandings appeared.
        Fear crept in.
      <br><br>
        I became insecure.
        Possessive.
        Afraid of losing you.
      <br><br>
        I didn’t know how to love calmly —
        I only knew how to love deeply.

        Still, we stayed.
        We fought the situation.
        Not each other.
        .

        You joined school.
        Life became busy.
        <br><br>
        From endless conversations,
        we came down to one hour a day.
        <br><br>
        I tried to understand.
        I tried to adjust.
        but i stand for you

        I planned to come to Ayodhya —

        July came with silence.
        One full month of fear and waiting.
        <br><br>
        I was scared.Broken.
        But then came your birthday — 29th July.

      I reached out.
      I tried to make you smile.
      To remind you how special you were.
        <br><br>
        We talked again.
        <br><br>
        Maybe that was us —
        breaking and choosing each other
        again and again.

      One fight came that changed everything.
    <br><br>

    Born from fear.<br>
    From misunderstanding.<br>
    From loving too intensely.
    <br><br>
     that septmeber wali figth ,
     you are ready to go and but if man love someone,
     he will never loose you , so i did , what i capable of ,
     50 mails
     <br><br>
     100calls
     <br><br>
     3 days of sleepless night

    After 3 days,<br>
    you said you were done.
    <br><br>
    I couldn’t accept it.
    and again try to solve then everythings goes well.
    <br><br>

    On 31st December,<br>
    we again had fight and we both decide not to 
    start this year together again.
    I stood in front of Mahadev and prayed:
    <br><br>

    <em>
      “If there is one thing I want forever,<br>
      it is her.i want her in life forever but i didn't know that prayer effect negatively”
    </em>
    <br><br>

    And somehow…<br>
    we found our way back again.
    <br><br>

    Stronger.<br>
    Deeper.<br>
    More intense.
    <br><br>

    But maybe…<br>
    too intense.

     <p>
      One fight came that changed everything.
    <br><br>
    One day,
      I replied late.
      Just ten minutes.
      Silence followed.
    <br><br>
      When you came back,
      you said you loved me.

      That same day,
      I was tired, disappointed, broken.
      beacuse i rejected in last round in interview and i just came home .


      My words weren’t gentle.
    <br><br>
      And that moment
      became the end.
    <br><br>
      Misunderstandings grew.
      Emotions exploded.
      People got involved.(my fault)

      And suddenly…
      we were gone.
      why this happenend ? 
      <br><br>
      everyone says girls first breakup in his mind and then in real. 
      is that real anushka ? that day are you prepared for that or its just triggered situation that lead us to this moment.
      my every fight was with you is for you for us , i just do that things that solved

      <h2>The Questions I Still Carry</h2>

      <p>
      I don’t really know where you are now.
      Not in my life…
      i'm not in your heart.
    <br><br>
      I sometimes wonder —
      have you moved on, or have you simply learned how to live with the silence?
      Are you truly happy,
      or just strong enough not to look back?
    <br><br>
      Will you ever love someone again
      the way we loved —
      without logic, without safety, without limits?
      The kind of love that stayed,
      even when it hurt.
    <br><br>
      Will you ever cry for someone
      you never met in real life —
      yet felt closer to
      than anyone you ever held?
    <br><br>
      Was the connection we felt mistaken?
      That quiet understanding…
      the way we sensed each other without words…
      the way distance never really felt like distance —
      was it all just coincidence?
    <br><br>
      Or was it something rare?

      In a generation full of options,
      endless choices,
      and easy exits —
      was choosing one person,
      again and again,
      really such an impossible thing?

      Does anyone else know
      what we shared?
      What we protected?
      What we promised?
    <br><br>
      Or does that part of you
      still belong only to us?

      I don’t know who stands beside you now.
      I don’t know what advice surrounds you.
      I don’t even know
      what version of me lives in your memories.
    <br><br>
      But I know this —
      what I felt was real.
      What I gave was honest.
      And what we had
      was never ordinary to me.
    <br><br>
      I don’t write this
      to pull you back,
      or to disturb your peace.
    <br><br>
      I write this because
      some connections don’t fade —
      they just become quiet.

      And if, in some still moment,
      you ever feel there is something unsaid…
      something unfinished…
      something no one else seems to understand —

      you already know
      where to find me.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        99.99% of my heart says leave and moved on but that 0.1% 
        still have a hope but i know that hope was useless now .
        Some doors don’t knock —
        they simply stay open, waiting for truth.
        i still missed you but .............
        i still want to fight you but ......
